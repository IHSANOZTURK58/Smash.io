## Best Practices (Quick Reference)

1. **Start with goal** - What are we building/fixing?
2. **Max 10 tasks** - If more, break into multiple plans
3. **Each task verifiable** - Clear "done" criteria
4. **Project-specific** - No copy-paste templates
5. **Update as you go** - Mark `[x]` when complete
